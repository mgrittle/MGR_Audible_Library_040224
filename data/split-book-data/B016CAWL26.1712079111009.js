And some have the wisdom never to wield it.</b> </p> <p>The Red Knight has stood against soldiers, armies, and the might of an empire without flinching. He's fought on real and magical battlefields alike, and now he's facing one of the greatest challenges yet. A tournament. </p> <p>A joyous spring event, the flower of the nobility will ride against each other for royal favor and acclaim. It's a political contest - one that the Red Knight has the skill to win. But the stakes may be higher than he thinks. The court of Alba has been infiltrated by a dangerous faction of warlike knights, led by the greatest knight in the world: Jean de Vrailly - and the prize he's fighting for isn't royal favor but the throne of Alba itself.... </p> <p><b>This is the third book in the Traitor Son Cycle, following <i>The Red Knight</i> and <i>The Fell Sword</i>. </b> </p>";
