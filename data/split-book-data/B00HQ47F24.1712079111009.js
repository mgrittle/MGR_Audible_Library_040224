But despite ridding the kingdom of horrific monsters and using his unequaled swordsmanship to help a new queen ascend to the throne, he has no time to savor these early victories. </p> <p>He’s been warned that if he remains in the Starlands much longer, his death is more than just likely - it’s inevitable. Now a deposed prince plots Queen Talitha’s ruin from the shadows while sending numerous assassins to claim Rigel’s life. Even worse, if Rigel and Talitha ever consummate their growing passion, it will only hasten the hero’s demise. </p> <p>Yet Rigel refuses to be cowed by visions of doom. With enemies closing in on all sides and traitors already in their midst, he and Talitha risk all to secure lasting peace in the kingdom...but will the cost prove too high? </p>";
