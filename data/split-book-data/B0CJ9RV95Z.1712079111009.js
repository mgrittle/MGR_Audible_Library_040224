Will her life finally return to normal? (Or as normal as possible when one is mated to an elf, has a goblin for a roommate, and a dragon for a neighbor?)</p> <p>All Matti has left to do is to fulfill her obligation to Mikki the Wrench. That task, however, takes an unexpected turn when she encounters a powerful dark-elven artifact.</p> <p>Before she knows it, the foul relic has marked her, leaving her cursed as it steals her magic—and threatens to steal her life.</p> <p>If she can’t figure out how to remove the curse, she may lose everything she’s fought so hard to achieve.</p>";
