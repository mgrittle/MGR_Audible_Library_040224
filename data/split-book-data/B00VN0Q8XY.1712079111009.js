window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i></b><b>BESTSELLER • A rollicking alien invasion thriller that embraces and subverts science-fiction conventions, from the author of the worldwide phenomenon </b><b><i>Ready Player One </i></b><br> <b><br> “Exciting . . . mixes </b><b><i>Star Wars</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>The Last Starfighter</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Independence Day,</i></b><b> and a really gnarly round of </b><b><i>Space Invaders</i></b><b>.”—</b><b><i>USA Today </i></b><b>• “A thrilling coming of age story.”—</b><b><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b><br> <br> Zack Lightman has never much cared for reality. He vastly prefers the countless science-fiction movies, books, and videogames he's spent his life consuming. And too often, he catches himself wishing that some fantastic, impossible, world-altering event could arrive to whisk him off on a grand spacefaring adventure. <br> <br> So when he sees the flying saucer, he's sure his years of escapism have finally tipped over into madness. <br> <br> Especially because the alien ship he's staring at is straight out of his favorite videogame, a flight simulator callled <i>Armada—</i>in which gamers just happen to be protecting Earth from alien invaders. <br> <br> As impossible as it seems, what Zack's seeing is all too real. And it's just the first in a blur of revlations that will force him to question everything he thought he knew about Earth's history, its future, even his own life--and to play the hero for real, with humanity's life in the balance. <br> <br> But even through the terror and exhilaration, he can't help thinking: Doesn't something about this scenario feel a little bit like . . . well . . . fiction? <br> <br> At once reinventing and paying homage to science-fiction classics,<i> Armada</i> is a rollicking, surprising thriller, a coming-of-age adventure, and an alien invasion tale like nothing you've ever heard before.</p>";
