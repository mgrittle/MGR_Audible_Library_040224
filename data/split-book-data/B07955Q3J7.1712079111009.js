window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An elite forces officer with a dreadful reputation. A bookish paleontologist with a love for mysteries. An ancient stronghold full of secrets that will take both of them to unearth. </p> <p>Professor Lilah Zirkander (yes, she's related to the famous pilot, and no, she can't get him to autograph your undergarments) is looking forward to a summer in the paleontology lab, researching and cataloging new fossils. But that summer takes an unexpected turn when the king sends her into the Ice Blades to a secret mine where ancient dragon bones have been discovered. Rumor has it that they're cursed and dangerous, but Lilah is more concerned about dealing with the outpost commander, a fierce officer with the temperament of a crabby badger. </p> <p>As punishment for irking the king, Colonel Vann Therrik is overseeing the hardened criminals working in the remote Magroth Crystal Mines. He would like a chance to redeem himself - and escape the loathsome duty station - but nothing is going his way. Cursed fossils have delayed production, miners are trying to escape, and now a scientist has shown up, making demands on his time. Worse, she's the cousin of his nemesis General Zirkander. As if one Zirkander in his world wasn't bad enough. </p> <p>Investigating the fossils leads Lilah and Vann into the depths of Magroth Mountain where centuries-old secrets lurk, and a long-forgotten threat stalks the passages. To have any chance at survival, they'll have to work together and perhaps learn that neither is what the other expected. </p> <p><i>Shattered Past</i> is a stand-alone novel set in the author's Dragon Blood world. </p>";
