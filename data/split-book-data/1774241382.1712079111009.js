As suspicion spreads, neighbor turns against neighbor, friend against friend. Blades are drawn in dark alleyways and well-lit taverns alike, and the world's last bastion of hope totters on the brink of destruction, a knife held at its own throat.</p> <p>If Perennia is to be saved from the approaching threat, then its salvation will come not from great kings or queens, but at the hands of ordinary men and women, many whose hands are long-stained with the blood of innocents.</p>";
