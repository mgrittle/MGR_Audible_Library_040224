window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Enslaved and Forced to Fight Dragons</b> </p> <p>This box set contains over 2,000 pages of epic space fantasy, and tells the complete saga, with a real ending. Yes, we also have a roleplaying game, and a sequel series! </p> <p>“If you grew up playing <i>D&amp;D</i>, <i>Rifts</i>, <i>Spelljammer</i>, or <i>Starcraft</i>, and want to see magic in space done right, then get ready to lose the next sixty hours of your life.” — The Author’s Totally Biased Friend </p> <p><b><i>Tech Mage</i></b><b> (Book one)</b> </p> <p>Aran awakens in chains with no memory. He’s conscripted into the Confederate Marines as a Tech Mage, given a spellrifle, then hurled into the war with the draconic Krox and their Void Wyrm masters. </p> <p><b><i>Void Wyrm</i></b><b> (Book two)</b> </p> <p>Major Voria stands ready to accept the cost for her actions at Marid. Stripped of command and resources, Voria must find a ship and rally a crew. Somewhere within the Umbral Depths lays a hidden world, a world that the dead god Marid intended her to find. </p> <p><b><i>Spellship</i></b><b> (Book three)</b> </p> <p>Voria, Aran, and Nara survived their trip into the Umbral Depths. They retrieved the Talon, and are now searching for the First Spellship, the key to victory in their war against the Krox. Their search leads them to Virkonna, the home of the Last Dragonflight, a world where Dragons still rule. The world where Aran was born. </p> <p><b><i>War Mage</i></b><b> (Book four)</b> </p> <p>The Krox have finally reached their end game, and the sector will never be the same. Their relentless fleet darkens the skies of New Texas, home of the fabled Ternus shipyards. Their only hope lies with their sworn allies, the Shayans. But the Shayans refuse to help. </p> <p><b><i>Krox Rises</i></b><b> (Book five)</b> </p> <p>Nebiat has seized godhood, and now controls Krox, the most powerful elder god in the sector. Both Ternus and Shaya know she is coming, but their preparations cannot save them. She launches a strike at Ternus that cripples their home world, and shatters their fleets. </p> <p><b><i>Nefarius </i></b><b>(Book six)</b> </p> <p>Krox's assault on Shaya has been foiled, but the cost was bitter. Ternus lies in ruins, its gravity doubled by a god. Shaya is a paradise, but one populated by a mere handful of survivors. Only one power strong enough to oppose Krox remains...The Last Dragonflight. </p> <p><b><i>Godswar</i></b><b> (Book seven)</b> </p> <p>Nefarius has risen. She is implacable. Unstoppable. God after god is fallen and consumed, and each time the terrible dragon-goddess grows stronger. </p> <p>One possibility of victory remains. Aran, Nara, and Kazon discover their true purpose, left by the elder god Xal when he planned for his own demise. With this contingency they have one chance to oppose Nefarius. One chance to stop the goddess that will devour everything. </p> <p><b>Want to make your own characters? The Magitech Chronicles RPG system allows you to be part of the action long after you finish the books.
