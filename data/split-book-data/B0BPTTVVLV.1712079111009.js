window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hardly have they left the Forest of Ire and its horrors behind them when the Thirteenth Paladin decides to head for the Green Sea with his friends to fulfil his old promise of bringing the necromancer to justice, who has been holding the fertile lands surrounding the horse people and their Paladin, Blazing Eyes, in his bony grip for far too long. But it is not alone the necromancer with his deadly traps who is testing the companions. HE, WHO FORCES has his own plans to bring death and destruction to the Paladins. And then, to top it all off, the gods play a trick that none of them would ever have expected . . .</p>";
