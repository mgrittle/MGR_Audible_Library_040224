She asked only one service in return.... So Wallie became the Goddess' champion - and promptly found himself on the losing side in a battle against magics far beyond any the priests of the Goddess could hope to summon. </p> <p>After eons of exile, sorcerers walked the World again, claiming lands and souls for their Fire God. Wallie quickly found that swords were no match for spells - and how could mere mortals prevail against the powers of magic?</p>";
