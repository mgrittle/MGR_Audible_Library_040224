window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The award-winning epic fantasy series continues with this fourth volume of The Aldoran Chronicles.</b></p> <p><b><i>Ayrion</i></b></p> <p>Everything Ayrion has ever believed about his people is brought into question as an inconceivable heritage dating back millennia is revealed. Sent by the wizard Nyalis, Ayrion is tasked with not only returning to the Lost City—the one place that had forsaken him—but convincing his people to abandon who they are and leaving the only home they’ve ever known.</p> <p><b><i>Adarra</i></b></p> <p>With the possibility of an impending Tallosian invasion, Adarra finds herself whisked away in the middle of the night to join the ambassadorial team as they attempt to establish a dialogue between her people and the savage Northmen. Aboard a ship full of Sidaran Lancers, she sets sail for the Isle of Tallos, a place so hostile that only the bravest, or most foolish, dare venture.</p> <p><b><i>Ty</i></b></p> <p>After the return of the wizarding school of Aero’set, Ty and his companions begin to explore. Unfortunately, they find the city just as deadly as it is beautiful, and without anyone there to keep them in check, they once again find themselves in a battle for their lives.</p> <p><b><i>Ferrin</i></b></p> <p>With the threat of Sylas’s pursuit behind them, Ferrin and his companions leave Rhowynn and head east toward Sidara. An old promise to a cellmate has him traveling to Easthaven to find Azriel’s son. However, they barely make it out of Keldor when fate intervenes, and Ferrin and his companions find themselves heading in the opposite direction. For someone whose first instinct is to run and hide, Ferrin finds himself abandoning all reason as he risks all of their lives to defeat an enemy no one even believes to be real.</p> <p><b>Please Note:</b> If you have not yet listened to the first book in the Street Rats of Aramoor series, entitled <i>Street Rats of Aramoor Volume 1 &amp; 2</i>, you need to put this book down and listen to it. The characters and storyline in that book play a very important role in this fourth addition to The Aldoran Chronicles.</p>";
