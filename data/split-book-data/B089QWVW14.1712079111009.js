In fact, it almost seemed like he was a glutton for that sort of misery.</b> </p> <p>His friends were spread across two distant galaxies, separated by a heavily guarded magical portal and struggling to deal with a war now spilling over into both the technological realm as well as the magical one. And it was beginning to look like they’d reached their breaking point. </p> <p>But Charlie wasn’t about to give up, nor would he give in. If it was war they wanted, it was war they’d get, and he would cross space, and even time, if need be, to protect those he cared for. </p> <p>He would soon realize, however, that he was facing off against an adversary not only more powerful than any he’d ever battled, but one also possessing a diabolical plan worse than he’d ever imagined.</p>";
