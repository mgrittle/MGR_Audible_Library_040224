Calling himself Jack Thorn, he chooses an undead race, Deathlord. </p> <p>A mage by choice, and a swordsman by necessity, he soon finds out that he'll need to use much more than magic and steel to survive; strategy, creativity, and carefully chosen words can often accomplish what simple attacks can't. </p> <p>As the game becomes too real and touches a part of him that he'd rather leave buried, he is faced with two questions: Who is he, really? And who should he become? </p> <p><i>Challenge</i> is book one of the Unbound Deathlord series, a LitRPG saga. </p>";
