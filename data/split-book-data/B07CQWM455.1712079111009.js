Accompanied by Captain Kaika, the sentient soulblade Jaxi, and Rysha Ravenwood - the noble-born scholar and officer he definitely shouldn’t be developing feelings for - he must find a way to close a portal that’s allowing more and more dragons into the world. If he fails, all of humanity could fall to the powerful creatures.</p> <p>As if that wasn’t enough to worry about, the secret Trip has spent his whole life hiding, that he can draw upon magical power, is on the verge of being discovered. What will his superior officers think when they find out? What will Rysha think?</p> <p>But as Trip will soon discover, what he thought he knew about himself is only a shadow of the truth. Reality is far more incredible than he ever imagined.</p>";
