The literary equivalent of a Marvel Comics universe.\" (Michiko Kakutani, </b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>The epic novel, an African </b><b><i>Game of Thrones</i></b><b>, from the Man Booker Prize-winning author of </b><b><i>A Brief History of Seven Killings</i></b> </p> <p>In the stunning first novel in Marlon James' Dark Star trilogy, myth, fantasy, and history come together to explore what happens when a mercenary is hired to find a missing child. </p> <p>Tracker is known far and wide for his skills as a hunter: \"He has a nose,\" people say. Engaged to track down a mysterious boy who disappeared three years earlier, Tracker breaks his own rule of always working alone when he finds himself part of a group that comes together to search for the boy. The band is a hodgepodge, full of unusual characters with secrets of their own, including a shape-shifting man-animal known as Leopard. </p> <p>As Tracker follows the boy's scent - from one ancient city to another; into dense forests and across deep rivers - he and the band are set upon by creatures intent on destroying them. As he struggles to survive, Tracker starts to wonder: Who, really, is this boy? Why has he been missing for so long? Why do so many people want to keep Tracker from finding him? And perhaps the most important questions of all: Who is telling the truth, and who is lying? </p> <p>Drawing from African history and mythology and his own rich imagination, Marlon James has written a novel unlike anything that's come before it: a saga of breathtaking adventure that's also an ambitious, involving read. Defying categorization and full of unforgettable characters, <i>Black Leopard, Red Wolf</i> is both surprising and profound as it explores the fundamentals of truth, the limits of power, and our need to understand them both.</p>";
