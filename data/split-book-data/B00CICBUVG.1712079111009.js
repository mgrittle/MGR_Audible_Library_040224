window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As it began, so shall it end - in magic, mystery, and majesty... <i>Magician's End</i> </p> <p>Thirty years ago, Raymond E. Feist wrote his first novel, <i>Magician</i>, a story about an orphan boy named Pug who is thrust by a war into captivity in an alien world, only to rise from slavery to become a Master Magician. <i>Magician</i> introduced readers to Midkemia and the Riftwars, an epic series of battles between Good and Evil that have scarred this remarkable realm for generations. Now, after 29 books (authored and coauthored), Feist delivers the crowning achievement of his renowned best-selling career: <i>Magician's End</i>, the final chapter of the Chaoswar Saga and the climax of his extraordinary Riftwar Cycle. </p> <p>An uneasy quiet has settled upon Midkemia in the wake of a surprise invasion. But the land is far from peaceful. Leaderless, the Kingdom is on the brink of anarchy and civil war, unless Hal conDoin, Duke of Crydee, and his brothers can rally their allies to crown a new king. They must move quickly, for war has left the land vulnerable to an agency of horrific destruction not of this world. No one is safe, not even the Star Elves whose city deep in the Grey Tower Mountains has come under attack by an ancient darkness that seeks to extinguish every living thing in Midkemia. </p> <p>Yet the bravery of determined warriors - brothers in blood and arms - is not enough to ensure the Kingdom's preservation without the magic of the Master Sorcerer Pug. A powerful spell has trapped him, his son Magnus, and two unlikely allies in an unfamiliar realm, and they must find their separate ways home - a journey of memory and discovery that will illuminate the truth of the destiny that awaits them. But to save Midkemia - and everything he has fought for and all he cherishes - Pug will have to pay the ultimate price. </p> <p>A breathtaking tale of elves and men, love and hate, ambition and sacrifice, intrigue and brotherhood, war and peace, <i>Magician's End</i> brilliantly captures the essence of life and the eternal struggle for survival. It is an extraordinary ending to the magnificent saga that has made award-winning Raymond E. Feist a legend.</p>";
