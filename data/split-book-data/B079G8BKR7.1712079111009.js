window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Lee is a quiet and unassuming office worker who leads a life of solitude, comfort, and routine. Day in and day out, he shuts off his brain, keeps his head down, and goes about doing his job and minding his own business. That is, he does until a drunken god shows up randomly one day and whisks him off into another world, demanding that Lee serve as his pawn in a game between the gods. Now, trapped in a completely different world full of danger, magic, and creatures he's never imagined outside of fairy tales and video games, Lee has to figure out how to stay alive long enough to make it back home.</p> <p>Soundbooth Theater dives into another instant RPG Gamelit classic in <i>War Aeturnus</i>. With this piece of reverent comedy and philosophy about the role of belief in our modern times, Charles Dean has filled a void in the world of Gamelit by creating a Candide for the genre. Not only will Lee's exploits with his psychotic sidekick, Miller, make listeners laugh and spit out their Mountain Dew, it may even convince them to get off the couch for a little while and explore the world outside of video games and fantasy.</p> <p>The Soundbooth Theater team for this production:</p> <ul> <li>Jeff Hays - Narration, Characters, Production Supervision</li> <li>Dalton Lynne - Proofing</li> <li>Alex Tate - Production, Editing, Mastering</li> </ul>";
