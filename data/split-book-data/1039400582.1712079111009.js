Not only does the journey bring with it more death and destruction - and loss - than he ever imagined, it revives the shadows of a forgotten past. The only way forward is to follow the footsteps of the legendary Tyrus Rechs.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as the galaxy struggles to steady itself following the fall of a corrupt and bloated republic, dangerous threats vie for power.
