Amazingly, Charlie thought they might actually pull it off... that is if Lady Luck decided to play nice for a change. Unfortunately, knowing his fortunes, the odds of that were slim to none. </p> <p>The aliens were coming, that much was certain. What they could do to stop them, however, remained up in the air. Having joined forces with the mighty AIs overseeing the planet and its defenses, at least their toys had been upgraded accordingly. The magic users now had big guns. But against a magical enemy they couldnâ€™t see coming? </p> <p>All the weapons in the system would not be of any use. They were screwed. That is, unless they could somehow harness their own magic. That, or perhaps bring to bear something entirely new, spawned not in a distant galaxy, but rather in their own realm.</p>";
