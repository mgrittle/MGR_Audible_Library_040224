window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Winner of the Arthur C. Clarke Award</b></p> <p>The metropolis of New Crobuzon sprawls at the center of the world. Humans and mutants and arcane races brood in the gloom beneath its chimneys, where the river is sluggish with unnatural effluent and foundries pound into the night. For a thousand years, the Parliament and its brutal militias have ruled over a vast economy of workers and artists, spies and soldiers, magicians, crooks, and junkies.</p> <p>Now a stranger has arrived, with a pocketful of gold and an impossible demand. And something unthinkable is released.</p> <p>The city is gripped by an alien terror. The fate of millions lies with a clutch of renegades. A reckoning is due at the city’s heart, in the vast edifice of brick and wood and steel under the vaults of Perdido Street Station.</p> <p>It is too late to escape.</p>";
