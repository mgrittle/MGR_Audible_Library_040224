They have become the very flesh of war, but their history of honor has been forgotten. Now a bounty has been issued, one which calls for the extermination of their race. To survive they must awaken to what they have lost, before their enemies begin to gather. </p> <p>Born in the midst of a bloody conflict, Tryton bears a heart of peace. His talent will command respect, but his nature is the true weapon. To wield it he must rise to lead them all - without sacrificing his soul. The fate of his people lies with him, but the seeds of destruction have already been sown. </p> <p>And the harvest has come. </p>";
