window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An international Amazon best-selling title. Includes all three novels in the Riven Wyrde Saga.</b></p> <p>They thought the fae were a myth.... They were wrong.</p> <p>As the son of a mere merchant, Klöss wants nothing more than to pass his trials and join the ranks of the Bjornmen raiders, breaking free of his father’s ambitions and following in the footsteps of his forebears. Times are changing in the Barren Isles. The centuries-old traditions of coastal plunder are making way for outright conquest, and the threat of war is looming.</p> <p>Found abandoned in the forests of Anlan, Devin wants nothing more than a simple life. But fate, it seems, has other plans. As his sleepy village transforms in the face of foreign invaders, rumors tell of creatures seen in the moonlight, shadowy figures with eyes of amber flame. The fae are returning to the world of Haven, and vengeance is within their grasp.</p> <p>As the first battles rage between the Anlish and the Bjornmen invaders, only one man knows the true threat facing Haven. But can he convince anyone before it is too late?</p> <p><b>More than 100,000 copies downloaded worldwide from this epic fantasy series, perfect for fans of Patrick Rothfuss, Feist, Peter V.
