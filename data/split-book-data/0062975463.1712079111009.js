window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“A massive, entertaining tale.” (</b><b><i>Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>The Serpentwar rages on! </b></p> <p>In <i>Rage of a Demon King</i> - the spellbinding third installment in Raymond E. Feist’s masterful epic fantasy, The Serpentwar Saga - the imperiled realm of Midkemia confronts its most devastating horror, as a nightmare beyond imagining descends upon the war-torn land determined to devour and destroy. A terrible conflict reaches a breathtaking climax - a world-annihilating conflagration that pits serpent against man and magician against demon. </p> <p><i>Rage of a Demon King</i> is Feist at his best, solidifying his standing along with Terry Goodkind, George R. R. Martin, and Terry Brooks as the elite creators of epic sword and sorcery fantasy. </p>";
