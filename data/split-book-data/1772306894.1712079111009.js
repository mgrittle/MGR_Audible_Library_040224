window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Now that Trip’s siblings are safely back in the capital, he would like it if life got back to normal. As normal as possible for a half-dragon army officer learning to use his magical powers when he isn’t busy piloting with Wolf Squadron.</p> <p>But trouble keeps popping up, and the capital isn’t the safe haven Trip had hoped. More and more dragons are working together, with attacks growing frequent as they scheme to claim the country for themselves. Equally daunting, Rysha wants to introduce Trip to her parents, parents who want a proper nobleman for their daughter, not some odd commoner sired by a dragon.</p> <p>If Trip is to have any chance of bringing peace to the country - and impressing Rysha’s parents - he’ll have to finally and fully embrace what he is and what he can do. Before time runs out.</p>";
