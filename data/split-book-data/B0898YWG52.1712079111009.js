window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The multi-award wining novel </b><b><i>A Prince's Errand</i></b><b>, book one of Tales of the Amulet, begins an exciting new epic fantasy saga.</b></p> <p>Long ago, men harnessed the Channels of Power, creating tevisrals: devices capable of manifesting magic. But men weren't the only ones to accomplish such feats. Dragons crafted the most sophisticated tevisrals. These shaped the world, defining civilization of man and elf alike.</p> <p>Over the centuries, the people of Kalda have fallen into a dark age, where elves are estranged from men and dragons have retreated into legend. Tevisrals are scarce, and men are willing to trade everything for them. But there are some who wish to bury the past, and in their lands, possessing tevisrals is tantamount to treason.</p> <p>Still, daring men scour the world in search of Kalda's past. One such man, the scholar Krindal, seeks an ancient order known as the Keepers of Truth and Might. He yearns for their knowledge, long feared lost.</p> <p>Prince Kaescis Midivar also searches for these Keepers. The assassination of his uncle, the emperor of Mindolarn, killed his hopes of peace with his empire's enemies. His empire's survival hinges upon unearthing the Keepers' secrets.</p> <p>An aging warrior Cornar Dol'shir longs to be home with his wife. But his retirement must wait, as his band of adventurers is recruited to help find the Keepers' hidden temple on the Isle of Klindala.</p> <p>Haunted by his tragic past, Iltar, the Son of Adrin, does not join in the search for the Keepers. Instead, he seeks to unravel the mysteries held within a volume of prophecy foretelling the advent of the Unspoken One and the return of the Crimson Eye. His search takes him to the Empire of Mindolarn, where all is not as it seems.</p> <p><b>An ancient war was won by a simple amulet. It brought peace, but in the wrong hands, it could spell a doom, the likes of which no world has ever seen.</b><br> <br> <b>May the Crimson Eye remain hidden for all time!</b></p>";
