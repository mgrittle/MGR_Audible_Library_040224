I think.</b> </p> <p>When a missing person case brings me into contact with the only other supernatural creature I have ever seen, it’s not long before I am ass-deep in trouble. </p> <p>The police don’t like me, there’s a clandestine organisation who want me to join them, and what might be a demon trying to catch me. When I refuse to play ball with any of them, my life starts to get tough, but I had no idea how low they might stoop to force my hand. </p> <p>Soon they will find out just how badly they underestimated me. I hope. Have I bitten off more than I can chew? </p> <p>Somehow, I need to escape captivity, cross to a mysterious demon realm, rescue a girl, and find my way back. Easy, right? It might be if they hadn’t confiscated my wand. </p> <p>Thankfully, I’m not alone, I have a powerful werewolf as an ally. If only he wasn’t such an annoying, snarky d-bag.</p>";
