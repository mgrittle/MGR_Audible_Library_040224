window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“Undeniably riveting.” (<i>Booklist</i>)</p> <p>The terrible Emerald Queen is vanquished...but the war in Midkemia is not yet won, as the remarkable Raymond E. Feist concludes his magnificent Serpentwar Saga with <i>Shards of a Broken Crown</i> - a spellbinding tale of magic, conflict, and treachery that sees the rise of a new threat from the ashes of defeat, an evil poised to strike mercilessly at realm triumphant but weakened by war.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is epic fantasy adventure at its finest - a classic that stands tall alongside the best works of Terry Goodkind, George R. R. Martin, Terry Brooks, and other acclaimed fantasists. Feist once again works his breathtaking magic in <i>Shards of a Broken Crown</i>, and, as always, he “brings a new world alive” (<i>Portland Oregonian</i>).&nbsp;</p>";
