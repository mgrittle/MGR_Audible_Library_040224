Half of her team is missing or dead. Meanwhile, the fighting in the capital has escalated, the Imperial Barracks have been taken by a pretender, and a deadly new danger threatens the populace.</p> <p>Amaranthe’s hopes of returning Emperor Sespian to the throne and bringing peace to the empire are dwindling by the hour. To make matters worse, her strongest ally - and closest friend - has been captured and is under a powerful wizard’s control. If she can’t figure out a way to free Sicarius, he may kill them all when they meet next.</p>";
