Vichetral's dominion over the duchy of Alshar has grown ever darker, with slavery now legal and vicious gangs brutally enforcing his will.</p> <p>Their enemies infiltrating even the Shadow Council in the hunt for Gatina and her family, Gatina's father decides to meet with the mighty Sea Lords and discover if any are willing to join the effort to take down Vichetral. The voyage also offers Gatina a chance to learn about her distant relatives, who wield their power amidst the waves, and to enhance her facility with her very own, newly forged shadowblade.</p> <p>But danger can follow across water as well as land. And Gatina soon finds herself in a desperate battle from which the winner will sail away as the vanquished sinks into the briny deep . . . forever.</p> <p><b>The Spellmonger: Legacy and Secrets trilogy introduces a younger Gatina, the Kitten of Night, as she comes into her own as a shadowmage.</b></p>";
