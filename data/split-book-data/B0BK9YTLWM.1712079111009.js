And yet the world keeps spinning....</p> <p>A new threat has emerged, but this one is coming from inside <i>Awaken Online</i>. An unknown guild has somehow managed to threaten the game world. Yet, unlike Jason's former battles, his enemies are unclearâ€”hidden in the shadows and hiring others to do their dirty work, including the infamous <i>Death and Taxes</i>. Without a clear enemy or way to stop this threat, Jason is forced to do something he never thought he would...ask for help.</p> <p>Perhaps the united might of the avatars may be enough to subdue this new threat. Assuming they can overcome their issues and learn to fight together, they may be able to save AO.<br> <br> And if not...they'll have front row seats to the end of the world.</p>";
