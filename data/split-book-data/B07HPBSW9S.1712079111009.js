Dante suspects his next target will be Bressel, where the Tanarians have established their court in exile. The only chance to stop the lich will be to forge a fragile alliance between the bitter enemies of three different lands: Tanar Atain, Mallon, and Narashtovik.</p> <p>The city stands on the brink of rebellion. Yet even if Dante, Blays, and Gladdic can unite it, they still might not have the strength to stand against the army of the lich.</p> <p>One last hope may stop the coming destruction: the legendary Spear of Stars. But the weapon was lost long ago. To find it again, they may have to travel further than they've ever known.</p>";
