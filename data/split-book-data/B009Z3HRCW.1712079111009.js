window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Those who read and enjoyed the original three-volume series, <i>The Seventh Sword</i>, will remember that the original trilogy presents a series of surprising endings, especially in the third volume. In order to avoid spoilers, the author has chosen to skirt some issues central to those volumes in the description for this new, original and additional volume which follows the original series publications by well over a decade. New readers may wish to start with <i>The Reluctant Swordsman, The Seventh Sword 1; The Coming of Wisdom, The Seventh Sword 2 and The Destiny of the Sword, The Seventh Sword 3</i>, before starting on this brand-new adventure set in the world of <i>The Seventh Sword</i>. </p> <p>The Reluctant General</p> <p>For 15 years the truce has held. Swordsmen of the Tryst of Casr have kept the peace and extended the rule of law over half the World, but now sorcerers have started killing swordsmen again, and swordsmen traitors are aiding them. Shonsu-who was Wallie Smith before he became a swordsman of the seventh rank and liege lord of the Tryst-must once more gird on the seventh sword of Chioxin, and this time he rides out to fight the war that he hoped would never come. As he leads his army forth, its two most junior members are Vixini, son of Shonsu, and Addis, son of Nnanji, who has an oath of vengeance to fulfill. Their failure or success will determine the fate of the World for the next thousand years.</p>";
